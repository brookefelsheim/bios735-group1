What we want to do:
- Remove Solar Radiation 
- Dew Point Temperature
- Visibility 10 m
- Visibility 10 m


- REMOVE ALL DATA POINTS WHERE FUNCTION DAY = NO


Want to add:
- Weekend variable
- Try changing hours to 6 hour blocks and sum bike counts and seeing if that improves (compare using BIC value)
- Try splines
- Temperature change to Max and Min for day
- Humidity change to be consistent with temperature


** Idea make time that is before 4 am be that of last day

Variables in Model 
- Date (Random Effect)
- Hour/Time Chunk
- Max/Min Temp
- Max/Min Humidity
- Windspeed
- Make Rain binary and Snow binary and combine
- Weekend
- Seasons 
- Holiday



```{r}
bike = read.csv("SeoulBikeData.csv")
plot(bike$Hour, bike$Rented.Bike.Count)
```
